This is the first phase in the CrossFit competitive season and lets you rank your fitness against the rest of the world. Last year, over 324,000 people participated in the Open! The&nbsp;<a href="http://crossfitsouthbrooklyn.com/challenge-overview">LFPB Challenge</a> is a great opportunity to jump start your ability to perform better in this year's events. If you're an Open veteran or a first timer curious as to how you stack up, NOW is the time to start refining your inputs and skill work to help you give it all come February. For many of us weekend-warrior CrossFitters, this is an exciting benchmark in our training year and ignites a little competitive fire to help you get the most out of your training, nutrition, and recovery.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Coach DO has been the competition director for the North East/East Regions for the past six years. On top of helping run the Regionals, he leads a crew that helps verify video submissions for the North East and Canada East Regions. Here is his video submission for 14.2, the second event in 2014. In 2015, we saw this same exact workout come up again. Coach DO was able to get 14 more reps, which according to the comments section required him to<em> "stop feeling sorry for myself and bust ass to get to the next round."</em> Get after it today people, and <a href="http://crossfitsouthbrooklyn.com/challenge-overview" target="_blank">sign up for the Challenge</a>!</strong></p>

                <![CDATA[<h3 class="body">Front Rack Step-Ups / Chin-Ups Superset*</h3>
<div id="item21676134" class="body">
<p><strong>1A) Front Rack Step-Ups</strong></p>
<p>Perform  3 x 8-12 reps on each leg. Start the cycle light enough to make 12 reps  on each leg without too much difficulty, and move up in weight week to  week from there. Use your non-dominant leg to set the weight and only do  as much weight and as many reps as that side can perform. The end goal  by the end of the cycle is to perform 8-12 good reps on each leg with  about 1/3 of your Back Squat 1-rep max. Use a height that allows you to  be at full depth (hip crease below knee) when the working leg is on the  box. Come to full standing using the working leg before the trail leg  touches down for balance. Do not use the trail leg to help you stand up.  Use the trail leg as little as possible to push off from, and use a  tempo in which the down/eccentric phase of the movement is slower than  the up/concentric phase. The barbell comes off the floor. Stop the set  when you&rsquo;re not sure you can do another rep or two (i.e., do not bail a  bar on a box).</p>
<p><strong>1B) Chin-Ups or Supinated-Grip Body Rows</strong></p>
<p><em>Performance</em><br />Perform  4 sets of max reps. Once you can no longer clear your chin over the  bar, your set is over. Each rep starts from a dead hang. Initiate the  movement by pulling the shoulders down away from the ears and pull the  elbows as far down and back as possible. If you can touch your chest to  the bar on each rep, then do it. You should really be feeling these in  your lats.</p>
<p><em>Fitness</em><br />Perform 3 challenging (but  submaximal) sets of 2-4 reps using bands or a small partner assist as  needed to achieve full range of motion, followed by a 4th set for max  reps. These should be tough sets in a low rep range with the goal of  performing around 10-15 total reps. If you can do them unassisted but  only 1 at a time, then pepper in as many singles as you can in between  sets of Step-Ups during the lifting segment. Start and finish the  superset with a set of Chins to get all 4 sets in.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 80%;">*Superset means  that you perform a set of exercise A (in this case the Press) and then  after a short rest, 30 to 90 seconds, you perform a set of exercise B  (in this case the Chin-Ups or Supinated-Grip Body Rows). You then rest a  short period before returning to exercise A and continue in this  fashion until all warm up and work sets are completed.</span></p>

<h3>April 21-23th, 2017: The Starting Strength Seminar at CFSBK</h3>
<p>We are excited to be hosting the <a href="http://aasgaardco.com/store/brooklyn-new-york-seminar" target="_blank">Starting Strength Seminar</a> again this spring. <strong>The Starting Strength Seminar: The Complete Method</strong>&nbsp;teaches the system of barbell training detailed in the books&nbsp;<em><a href="http://aasgaardco.com/store/store.php?crn=199&amp;rn=413&amp;action=show_detail">Starting Strength: Basic Barbell Training</a></em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em><a href="http://aasgaardco.com/store/store.php?crn=199&amp;rn=328&amp;action=show_detail">Practical Programming for Strength Training</a></em>.  It features an in-depth examination of the physiology, biomechanics,  and execution of the 5 basic barbell exercises at a level of detail  unavailable in any other seminar in the industry. The SSS is the most  detailed exposure to any training method offered in the  fitness/exercise/training education marketplace, available to both the  serious strength and conditioning professional and the trainee  interested in improving personal performance under the bar.</p>
<p>The professional S&amp;C coach will take the course for the  credential the successful applicant obtains: The Starting Strength  Coach. The non-professional will take the course for the exposure to the  complete suite of Starting Strength materials and the chance to be  evaluated on its understanding, as either a possible precursor to  professional status or for personal development as a lifter and athlete.</p>
<p>This method deconstructs the five basic barbell exercises - the  squat, deadlift, press, bench press, and power clean - down to their  basic elements in biomechanics and skeletal and muscular anatomy, and  then derives a system for performing and coaching them based on the the  most efficient and productive way of approaching each movement.</p>
<p><strong>The Starting Strength Seminar: The Complete Method&nbsp;</strong>is an  intensive exposure to all the information from which the Starting  Strength system is derived. The 3-day format allows for an in-depth  exploration of the theoretical basis of the system, as well as a  thorough under-the-bar practical session for each exercise which  provides for the evaluation of each participant on the basis of both  lifting and coaching the method. The basics of barbell training are  developed into a logical and effective system that forms the best  possible foundation for any strength and conditioning program.&nbsp;<em>Please note that there are no prerequisites for attending this course.</em></p>
<p>The SSS currently offers two levels of completion. First, attendance  at the complete seminar provides a Certificate of Attendance. Competence  in the system will also be evaluated by the staff on the ability of the  participant to demonstrate understanding as both athlete and coach in  the practical sessions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Second, experienced coaches that wish to be candidates for the Starting Strength Coach credential&nbsp;<a href="http://aasgaardco.com/sss.html#ssc" target="_blank">can elect to be evaluated</a>&nbsp;at  a higher level of scrutiny. These coaches should come prepared with a  background in weight training and coaching, a working knowledge of  muscular and skeletal anatomy, an excellent familiarity with the  foundational texts, and an ability to communicate effectively. They will  be expected to conclusively demonstrate their ability to function as  coaches of the Starting Strength method.</p>
<p>Lifters who just want to improve their understanding of barbell  training, its techniques and its programming, can expect the most  informative and productive weekend available in the entire fitness  industry, guaranteed.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 110%;"><strong>Registration</strong></span><br />Enrollment is on a first come, first served basis. Each seminar has limited enrollment, with athlete:coach ratios of 5 or less.&nbsp;<br /><br />You  can secure your place with a deposit of 1/3 the seminar fee. Full  payment must be received at least 4 weeks before the start of the  seminar. Go <a href="http://aasgaardco.com/store/brooklyn-new-york-seminar" target="_blank">here</a> to register!</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 110%;"><strong>Program</strong></span><br /><strong>Friday 5-9pm:</strong> Coaching, Strength, Anatomy, Biomechanics<br /><strong>Saturday 8-8pm:</strong> Squat, Deadlift, Bench Press<br /><strong>Sunday 8-7pm:</strong> Power Clean, Press, Programming, Q&amp;A</p>

<h3>Francine D. on the Look, Feel, Perform Better Challenge</h3>
<p>Over the past few weeks, we've been sharing past <a href="http://crossfitsouthbrooklyn.com/challenge-overview" target="_blank">Look, Feel, Perform Better Challenge</a> participants' experiences to give you a better sense of what it's all about and what kind of results you might be able to expect. Today we're very happy to bring you the impressions of one of last year's winners! Here's how <strong>Francine D. </strong>responded to <strong>Coach Fox</strong>'s one-year-later follow-up questions...</p>
<p><strong>What was the most positive change you experienced during last years challenge?</strong></p>
<p>The most positive change was my relationship to alcohol. I used to drink wine like a fish and never realized the degree to which it was affecting my performance, sleep, and body composition. I also think my relationship to food overall is now drastically different. I am now able to prioritize performance and general fitness over junk food cravings.</p>
<p><strong>What was the biggest challenge to overcome, and how did you deal with it?</strong></p>
<p>The biggest challenge was learning the difference between hunger and cravings. I followed the <a href="http://crossfitsouthbrooklyn.com/challenge-guidelines/" target="_blank">Level 2 Eater plan</a> and meal timing to a tee in order to have a rational action plan for addressing stress cravings.</p>
<p><strong>What has been the most lasting change from last year?</strong></p>
<p>Weight loss and body composition transformation&mdash;22 lbs lost since the beginning of the Challenge and 16% body fat achieved (after a second cut this fall). I also moved from a daily drinker to person who has an occasional drink.</p>
<p><strong>Will you be participating again this year?</strong></p>
<p>Yep! I'm thinking about maintaining or doing a massing diet alongside a hypertrophy program.</p>

                <![CDATA[<h3>Close-Grip Bench Press</h3>
<p><strong>Work up to a medium-heavy set of 8-12 reps. </strong></p>
<p>Use a grip that's about where you would usually perform a Strict Press, Push-Up, or Burpee. Control the down phase on  the bar. It should be slower than the up phase. If you start to grind on  either the descent or the ascent, then end the set. Use spotters on all  work sets.</p>

<h3>This Week at CFSBK in Review</h3>
<p><span style="font-size: 110%;">1.</span> <strong>The <a href="http://crossfitsouthbrooklyn.com/upcoming-events/01217-32517-look-feel-perform-better-challenge.html" target="_blank">Look, Feel, Perform Better Challenge</a> is upon us! See  that widget to the right of this post? All LFPB Challenge info can be  found there. </strong>Signing up is easy! Buy in with $30 cash at the front desk  and write your name on the big poster near the couches. Why should you sign up? <strong>Chas C.</strong>, who participated in last year's Challenge, says that one year later he has experienced "[a] significant loss of weight and boost in self-confidence." The biggest change, Chas tells us, has been his diet: "While there've been ups and downs since the end of the challenge, I've successfully jettisoned french fries for good and am generally much more cognizant of the fact that a little fat (or salad dressing, or whatever) goes a long, long way!" He'll be participating again this year!&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 110%;">2.</span> <strong>Our <a href="http://crossfitsouthbrooklyn.com/workout-of-the-day/2016/12/19/push-press-nft-work-121916.html" target="_blank">new 8-week programming cycle</a> started Monday.</strong> Remember that you can always see what's happening on the <a href="http://crossfitsouthbrooklyn.com/current-programming-cycle/" target="_blank">Current Programming Cycle</a> page.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 110%;">4.</span> <strong>We love dogs at CFSBK, which is why we're doing another Dogs of CFSBK calendar for 2017! </strong>100% of the proceeds go to <a href="http://www.pupstarzrescue.org/" target="_blank">PupStarz Rescue</a>,   a foster rescue started by our own <strong>Robyn O.</strong> Both the   desk&nbsp;calendar&nbsp;and wall&nbsp;calendar&nbsp;are available for a cash  donation of   $30-60.

<h3>The CFSBK Coaching Staff: Brett Ferguson</h3>
<p style="padding-left: 150px;"><em>Editor's note:</em> We're in the process of updating the bios on our <a href="http://crossfitsouthbrooklyn.com/coaching-staff/" target="_blank">Coaching Staff page</a>.  As we do so, we'll be posting the new bios to the main blog as a way of  reacquainting you with one of the main things that makes CFSBK a  special gym: our wonderful, talented coaching staff! <a href="http://crossfitsouthbrooklyn.com/workout-of-the-day/2016/12/1/snatch-nft-work-12116.html" target="_blank">Last time</a>, we gave you <strong>Coach Nick</strong>. Next, here's the newest member of our staff, <strong>Coach Brett</strong>...&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Brett grew up in Syracuse, New York, and participated in athletics at both the high school (All-State soccer and lacrosse) and collegiate levels. A recurring injury eventually forced him to take a step back from sports, and he began weight training. While Brett studied Jazz Bass Performance and Public Speaking in college and moved to Brooklyn with aspirations of becoming a touring musician, he continued bodybuilding until he couldn&rsquo;t stand going to the gym alone with his earbuds in, doing "chest" twice a week with the bros, and avoiding leg day anymore.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Enter CrossFit. It took a few months to grow on him, mostly because his range of motion was so poor that he couldn&rsquo;t physically get into some of the positions. After that, he couldn't get enough. He enjoyed the challenge of learning what CrossFit had to offer after being physically humbled by so many of its core movements and workouts.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Brett has previously worked as a personal trainer, frequently with clients on the road back from knee and shoulder injuries that required surgery. He&rsquo;s also coached at <a href="http://www.crossfitseattle.com/" target="_blank">Level 4 CrossFit Seattle</a> and was instrumental in the opening of a new CrossFit gym in Seattle.</p>
<p>Brett holds his CrossFit Level 1, CrossFit Weightlifting, NASM Certified Personal Trainer, and NASM Corrective Exercise Science Certificates.</p>

                <![CDATA[<h3>Front Rack Step-Ups / Chin-Ups Superset*</h3>
<p><strong>1A) Front Rack Step-Ups</strong></p>
<p>Perform 3 x 8-12  reps on each leg. Start the cycle light enough to  make 12 reps on each leg  without too much difficulty, and move up in  weight week to week from  there. Use your non-dominant leg to set the  weight and only do as much  weight and as many reps as that side can  perform. The end goal by the  end of the cycle is to perform 8-12 good  reps on each leg with about 1/3  of your Back Squat 1-rep max. Use a  height that allows you to be at full depth  (hip crease below knee) when  the working leg is on the box. Come to  full standing using the working  leg before the trail leg touches down  for balance. Do not use the  trail leg to help you stand up. Use the  trail leg as little as possible  to push off from, and use a tempo in which  the down/eccentric phase of the  movement is slower than the  up/concentric phase. The barbell comes off  the floor. Stop the set when  you&rsquo;re not sure you can do another rep or  two (i.e., do not bail a bar  on a box).</p>
<p><strong>1B) Chin-Ups or Supinated-Grip Body Rows</strong></p>
<p><em>Performance</em><br />Perform  4 sets of max reps. Once you can no  longer clear your chin over the bar,  your set is over. Each rep starts  from a dead hang. Initiate the  movement by pulling the shoulders down  away from the ears and pull the  elbows as far down and back as  possible. If you can touch your chest to the  bar on each rep, then do  it. You should really be feeling these in your  lats.</p>
<p><em>Fitness</em><br />Perform 3 challenging (but submaximal)  sets of 2-4  reps using bands or a small partner assist as needed to  achieve full  range of motion, followed by a 4th set for max reps. These should be   tough sets in a low rep range with the goal of performing around 10-15   total reps. If you can do them unassisted but only 1 at a time, then   pepper in as many singles as you can in between sets of Step-Ups during   the lifting segment.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 80%;">*Superset                    means  that you  perform a set of exercise A (in this     case     the       Press) and  then after a short rest, 30 to 90     seconds,    you      perform   a  set of exercise B (in  this  case  the  Chin-Ups or Supinated-Grip Body Rows). You   then  rest a  short   period    before       returning to    exercise A and     continue    in    this  fashion      until all    warm up and  work   sets are       completed.</span></p>
